The Great Beyond is brought to you by the same community (over at The Great Beyond) who host and play other modpacks and we decided to create our own! We've packed our exploration-focused pack to bursting with content from hundreds of mods so you can craft your own world, explore vast, far-away exotic lands, fight incredible bosses and tailor your player in your style.

We've created a pack, we'd like to play and we think you'll like it too. We've played (and continue to play) our pack and make it better, with more content and a balance between exploration, fantasy and magic and a sprinkling of tech.

The great beyond is out there and adventure awaits for you, will you go?
